## AWS Cloud Resume Project
 
This repo is my attempt at the Cloud Resume Challenge created by Forrest Brazeal. I have done this challenge in AWS cloud. The steps to the challenge are listed in the link below on Forrest's website. After I am done with the challenge I will also link my blog here in this space.
 
<p>●	Technologies Utilized: 
 AWS S3, Route53,
 Certificates Manager,
 CloudFront,
 API Gateway,
 Lambda,
 DynamoDB,
 Terraform,
 Terraform Cloud
 Git,
 Github,
 Python (Boto3),
 HTML, CSS, JavaScript


● Automated the backend and frontend infrastructure creation using Terraform to eliminate having manually configure the AWS resources in the AWS console.<br>
     ● Styled my HTML resume with CSS using a pre-built Bootstrap template<br>
     ● Deployed my HTML resume as an Amazon S3 static website.<br>
     ● Used HTTPS for security and set up Amazon CloudFront.<br>
     ● Pointed a custom DNS domain name to the CloudFront distribution<br>
     ● Created a visitor counter using Javascript and used Amazon's DynamoDB as a database to store the visitor counter.<br>
     ● Created an API using AWS's API Gateway and Lambda services.<br>
     ● Leveraged Python Boto3 and Lambda to automate & serve changes to/from DynamoDB using API Gateway<br>
     ● Created a GitHub repository for my back-end and front-end code.<br>
     ● Set up Cypress Test in GitHub actions to test API and website.<br>
     ● Set up CI/CD deployment with GitHub actions for backend and frontend to automate applying AWS resources using Terraform<br>
